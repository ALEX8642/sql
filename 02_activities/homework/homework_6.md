**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In reflecting on my approach to ethics in data science and machine learning, I recognize the critical importance of responsible data governance and the need for robust privacy protections. As I engage with data, I will ensure that it adheres to established governance frameworks, maintaining strict security protocols to prevent misuse, such as not personally identifiable information like names in my data. My commitment extends to objecting to projects that could detrimentally impact society, advocating for oversight to counteract the historical shortcomings of organizations in this regard. References to examples of such misuses are listed below:

Cambridge Analytica Scandal (2016): Cadwalladr, C., & Graham-Harrison, E. (2018). "The Cambridge Analytica Files." The Guardian.
Healthcare Disparities in AI: Obermeyer, Z., Powers, B., Vogeli, C., & Mullainathan, S. (2019). "Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations." Science.
COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) tool (2016): Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). "Machine Bias." ProPublica.

If I one day aspire to be a prominent professional in this field, I would leverage my influence to advocate for legal controls that ensure data science contributes positively to society. This would include pushing against harmful practices, such as those that prioritize anti-consumer objectives or exploit grey areas in privacy.

For instance, if I were evaluating data as an insurance professional and identified that it could lead to increased costs or loss of coverage for customers without justifiable evidence of higher risk, I would challenge its use. I would advocate for the collection of more comprehensive data, perhaps through well-conducted, peer-reviewed studies, to validate any claims made by the initial data, especially given that all the data we use is human, and therefore contains inherent bias that may not be easily corrected. This proactive stance not only promotes ethical integrity but also fosters a data science landscape dedicated to societal betterment. 

In conclusion, ethics surrounding data science, AI, machine learning, and privacy are among the most pressing issues of our time, and I am committed to approaching them with the utmost seriousness.
